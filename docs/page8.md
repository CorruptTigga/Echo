# Echo: Content Boundaries and Ethical Guardrails

This page outlines the ethical framework, content boundaries, and safeguards embedded in Echo to balance gritty realism with responsible game design.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

- **Realism With Responsibility:**  
  - Echo aims to depict a harsh Viking-era world authentically but within strict ethical limits.  
  - The goal is to challenge players while avoiding glorification of harmful or illegal behavior.

- **Player Agency vs. Ethical Lines:**  
  - Players have broad freedom, but some actions are explicitly banned or carefully limited.  
  - The game enforces these boundaries through design, narrative, and LLM moderation.

## 2. Prohibited Content

- **Illegal Activities:**  
  - No depiction or allowance of illegal acts such as underage marriage consummation, exploitation, or abuse beyond historical context warnings.  
  - Explicitly excludes content that violates platform policies or laws.

- **Exploitation and Abuse:**  
  - Graphic torture and sexual abuse are not shown in detail; descriptions are minimal and narrative-driven without glorification.  
  - Harmful scenarios that exploit NPC autonomy or player actions are moderated or blocked.

## 3. Sensitive Historical Topics

- **Slavery:**  
  - Presented strictly as a historical wartime practice (e.g., POW slavery), never racialized or glorified.  
  - NPCs’ responses to slavery reflect personal beliefs and cultural norms of the era.

- **Marriage and Age:**  
  - Age of consent is modernized (e.g., 16) for player comfort and ethical alignment.  
  - Historical references to child marriage are acknowledged but not enacted or depicted in gameplay.

## 4. Content Warnings and Transparency

- **Prominent Warnings:**  
  - Clear, upfront content warnings on game launch and store pages about mature themes and sensitive content.  
  - Players are informed about the nature of the simulation and potential discomfort.

- **Player Control:**  
  - Settings allow players to moderate content detail levels (e.g., violence descriptions).  
  - The narrative tone is adjustable to avoid excessive graphic detail.

---

## 5. NPC Autonomy and Ethics

- **Respecting NPCs as Simulated Persons:**  
  - NPCs have emotions, motivations, and autonomy influencing reactions to player actions.  
  - The game discourages exploitative behaviors through in-world consequences and social dynamics.

- **Monitoring and Moderation:**  
  - LLM detects and limits scenarios involving illegal or morally unacceptable actions.  
  - Player actions may trigger in-game consequences, faction sanctions, or narrative feedback.

## 6. Developer Responsibility and Modding

- **Moral Boundaries:**  
  - The developer maintains clear moral stances and enforces them strictly.  
  - Mods introducing banned or exploitative content will be actively discouraged or blocked.

- **Community Engagement:**  
  - Open dialogue with players about ethical concerns and content boundaries.  
  - Updates and patches will reflect ongoing considerations and feedback.

## 7. Summary

Echo’s ethical framework balances immersive realism with careful content guardrails, ensuring a mature, thoughtful experience that respects player freedom and societal norms without crossing legal or moral lines.
