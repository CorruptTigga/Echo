# Echo: Pregnancy and Generational Simulation

This page covers the detailed lifecycle simulation including pregnancy, family dynamics, aging, and generational continuity within Echo.

## 1. Lifecycle Simulation

- **Aging System:**  
  - NPCs age realistically over time according to the simulation steps.  
  - Age affects fertility, health, and mortality rates.  
  - Different life stages: Child, Adolescent, Adult, Elderly, Deceased.

- **Pregnancy Mechanics:**  
  - Pregnancy can result from consensual relationships or other game events (e.g., war captives).  
  - Gestation length modeled historically but adapted with modern ethical considerations (e.g., age limits).  
  - Pregnancy impacts NPC behavior, stats, and emotional state.  
  - Risk factors such as complications, mortality risk for mother and child.

- **Childbirth and Infant Care:**  
  - Newborn NPCs are generated with inherited traits from parents (genetics simulation).  
  - Infant care affects survival rates and future development.  
  - Family members, including extended kin, may participate in child-rearing.

## 2. Family Dynamics

- **Marriage and Partnerships:**  
  - Marriage reflects historical context but adapted with modern age cutoffs.  
  - Polygamy and concubinage modeled for Viking-era social realism.  
  - Partnerships affect social standing, alliances, and political power.

- **Inheritance and Succession:**  
  - Land, titles, and wealth pass down generations according to cultural rules.  
  - Conflicts over succession can drive factional intrigue and NPC motivations.

- **Parent-Child Relationships:**  
  - Emotional bonds develop and influence NPC behavior and loyalty.  
  - Education and mentorship impact skill development over childhood.

## 3. Mortality and Death

- **Natural Causes:**  
  - Aging, illness, and childbirth complications contribute to mortality.  
  - Environmental factors and nutrition also affect life expectancy.

- **Violence and Accidents:**  
  - Combat injuries, raids, and accidents are common causes of death.  
  - Death triggers emotional responses in relatives and community.

- **Legacy:**  
  - Deceased NPCs impact family status, faction strength, and ongoing narratives.

## 4. Technical Implementation

- **Lifecycle State Tracking:**  
  - Each NPC stores age, fertility status, pregnancy state, and health metrics.  
  - Pregnancy tracked by gestation timer linked to simulation steps.

- **Inheritance Algorithms:**  
  - Genetic traits and cultural attributes passed down probabilistically.  
  - Family trees dynamically updated with births, marriages, and deaths.

- **Emotional and Social Impact:**  
  - Pregnancy, childbirth, and death events update NPC emotions and relationships.  
  - Social events like weddings and funerals can trigger factional changes or quests.

## 5. Player Interaction

- **Player Family:**  
  - Player character can form relationships, marry, and have children, affecting gameplay.  
  - Generational progression offers long-term narrative depth.

- **Ethical Guardrails:**  
  - Age of consent and marriage cutoff enforced per modern standards for player and NPCs.  
  - Historical realism balanced with sensitivity to player comfort and legal norms.

## 6. Summary

Echoâ€™s pregnancy and generational simulation creates a living, breathing world where family, legacy, and life cycles matter. This system deepens immersion and emotional investment through realistic, ethically balanced NPC lifespans and relationships.
