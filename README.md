# Echo

**Echo** is a Viking-era, text-driven, open-world life simulation game designed to explore gritty realism, emergent NPC behavior, and deep systemic gameplay. Blending the sandbox nature of *Kenshi* with a DnD-like ruleset and a powerful LLM-driven Game Master, Echo aims to redefine what text-driven simulations can be.

## 🛠️ Features

- ⚔️ Viking-era life simulation with dynamic raiding, trade, war, and survival
- 💬 Player-driven interaction via natural language commands
- 🧠 Autonomous NPCs with emotions, memory, relationships, and personal goals
- 🎲 DnD 5e-style skills and dice-based randomness (e.g. `*attempt to climb cliff*`)
- 🧬 Realistic population systems, pregnancy, aging, and succession
- 🗺️ Hand-crafted hex-based world map with procedural characters and stories
- 🖥️ 2D tile-based rendering engine (Hex, Isometric, Square support)
- 🧠 Built-in LLM acts as a **Game Master**, handling logic, context, and responses

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 3.3 Core, ImGui
- **AI/Simulation**: LibTorch for custom LLM integration
- **Editor Tools**: Tiled (map editor)
- **UI**: Natural-language parser, markdown-powered UI

## 📌 Goals

- Push boundaries of narrative and systemic AI in games
- Model real-world dynamics (culture, hierarchy, emotion) without magic or fantasy
- Emphasize consequence-driven storytelling over scripted events
